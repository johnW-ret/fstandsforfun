F Stands for Fun
================

This is an F# tutorial setup as a single page at [fstandsfor.fun](fstandsfor.fun).

Goals:
1. Fun

   Only certain types of people find programming languages themselves "fun", so one goal is to show how easy it is to do fun things in F# by keeping the reader entertained.

   The current version uses Plotly.NET interactive graphs both as a fun way to add interactive content and a pivot toward new Python / Data Science oriented programmers, but further examples could include puzzles, bootstrapping a web app, etc.

2. Clear

   Not too wordy. A little bit of theory is fine, but only to help explain concepts. Try to not use features a reader might be unfamiliar with before showing them.

3. Actionable

   Examples should be immediately actionable to the extent possible. If possible, show a new thing that you couldn't have done before without the thing just demonstrated.

There may be more pages later, added in a blog or reference type format.
